                    <br />
                    <p>We are a friendly and active group of people who are passionate about climbing, walking, and scrambling; the 
                        range of abilities is wide. Our activities include regular climbing at Parthian (formerly RCC) on Wednesday evenings 
                        or the Climbing Hangar, regular 
                        meets away, and local socials. The club has a lively atmosphere and is a good way to meet like-minded 
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Usually the meets list covers monthly trips to areas such as the Lakes, North Wales, Peak district, Gower, 
                        Pembrokeshire, and Cornwall. We would 
                        typically camp or stay in a hut.  The club provides a perfect forum, through its Facebook site and WhatsApp group,
                        for organising additional trips.</p>
                    <p>We are a friendly group so, if you feel like meeting us first, before a climb, 
                        get in <a class="inlinetag" href="mailto:readingmc.info@gmail.com">touch</a>!</p>
